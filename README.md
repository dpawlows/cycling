# cycling

A program that realistically simulates the motion of a cyclist along a path!

cycling gives the position and velocity as a function of time of a cyclist given their power and a specified route (provided via a gpx file). Assumptions are made about he cyclist's aerodynamic profile and losses due to rolling resistance and internal friction.
